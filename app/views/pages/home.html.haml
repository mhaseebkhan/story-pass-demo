%h1 StoryPass Demo
%br
%p
  StoryPass is a new password recovery system which allows users to recover their password based on some images uploaded
  as a part of registration process. The images are selected based on a story by the user.
%p
  When the user wants to recover their password, he/she will be presented with an image having the images uploaded by
  the user meshed with random images retrieved from Flickr.
%p
  Each image would have two characters written on it and the recovery token would be the combination of these characters
  in the order which the user uploaded the images.
%p
  This project is a demo for the concept. Later on, the code would be extracted and converted to a gem that it can be
  used in any Rails project.
